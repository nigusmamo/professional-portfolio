      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        Hello! I'm <strong>Temesgen Geta</strong>, a passionate 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of
        Gondar.
        I enjoy building creative projects from simple websites to full systems.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I’m currently learning modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend programming.<br>
        My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer who can bring ideas to life through code.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Beyond coding, I love exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my skills every single day.

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        This portfolio website is one of my personal projects.
        I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show my work and practice web design.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I tried to make the page responsive so it looks good on both desktop and mobile. It took me time to adjust
        layouts and fix some design issues, but I learned a lot while doing it.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        My goal was to keep it simple, clean, and easy to use while improving my front-end skills.
